# What is Pseudo-class selectors in CSS

CSS pseudo-classes are used to add styles to selectors, but only when those selectors meet certain conditions. A pseudo class is expressed by adding a colon `(:)` after a selector in CSS, followed by a pseudo-class such as `first-child`, `last-child`, or `nth-child()`, like this:

```css
ul:first-child {
  color: red;
}
```

## :first-child

The `:first-child` is a pseudo class in CSS which represents the first element among a group of sibling elements. The `:first-child` Selector is used to target the first child element of it's parent for styling.

## :last-child
