## What is Semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML is the correct use of HTML to reinforce the meaning of content on a web page, rather than merely define its appearance.

## Why Use Semantic HTML?

Semantically correct HTML helps search engines, screen readers, and other user devices determine the significance and context of web content. In order to effectively represent the meaning of content, appropriate HTML elements are chosen according to inherent meaning, rather than how they appears visually on a rendered web page.

## Text-level HTML Semantics

In HTML, text-level elements such a `<strong>`, `<em>`, and `<cite>`, add semantic information within phrasing content, to explicitly indicate stress emphasis, strong importance, and citations, to name only a few examples.
