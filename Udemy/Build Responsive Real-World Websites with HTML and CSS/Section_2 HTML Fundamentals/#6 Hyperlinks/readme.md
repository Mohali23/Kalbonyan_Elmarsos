# What is the Hyperlinks in HTML

HTML links are hyperlinks. You can click on a link and jump to another document.\
When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.\
The tag responsible for this is `<a></a>`
The `<a>` tag has two required attributes:

- href
- target

## Example

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Go to google</a>
```

## Explain tag and attribute

`<a>` => The shorthand of tag is Anchor\
`href` => The attribute for defining the URL we need to go It or any page in our website, the shorthand for this attribute is hyper reference.\
`target` => attribute specifies where to open the linked document.\
The target attribute has more than value but the most important value is

- (\_blank) - Opens the document in a new window or tab
- (\_self) - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked

The text inside the tag is visible in the browser and takes the blue color
