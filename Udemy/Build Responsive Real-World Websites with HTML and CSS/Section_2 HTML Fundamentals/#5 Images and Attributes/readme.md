# What is the img tag and attributes in HTML

The `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.\
The `<img>` tag has two required attributes:

- src - Specifies the path to the image
- alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed

## Example

```html
<h1>مسابقة كالبنيان المرسوس لتعليم البرمجة</h1>
<img src="images/logo.jpg" alt="Albonyan Elmarsos logo" />
```

## Explain attributes

`src` => This attribute for the image path Which we need to embed in our HTML page Its shorthand for source\
'alt' => This attribute for alternative text we use this attribute for when the image is not loaded for any reason, and the search engine use to improve (Seo), Another reason for the persons who use a screen reader

### Result

![](images/logo.jpg)

> **_NOTE:_** The `<img>` tag does not have a closing tag you can use the self-close like this `<img>`
