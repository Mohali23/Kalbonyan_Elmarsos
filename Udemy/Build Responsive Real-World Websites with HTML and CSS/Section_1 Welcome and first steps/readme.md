# A High-Level Overview of Web Development

In this section Jonas Schmedtmann explained some concepts on web development, these concepts is

## Connection with server

what happens as we try to access this page is that our browser will send a request to the server where this page is hosted on the internet.
So each and every website is stored on something called a Server, which is basically a computer that is connected to the internet
and is able to receive requests like this one.
So again, when we browse to a certain website, our web browser will send a request to the server where the website is stored. So where it is hosted.
Then when the server receives the request, it will take all the files that make up the website and send them back to the browser.

## Static Web pages

Static Web pages are very simple. It is written in languages such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. For static web pages when a server receives a request for a web page, then the server sends the response to the client without doing any additional process. And these web pages are seen through a web browser. In static web pages, Pages will remain the same until someone changes it manually.

## Dynamic Web Pages

Dynamic Web Pages are written in languages such as CGI, AJAX, ASP, ASP.NET, etc. In dynamic web pages, the Content of pages is different for different visitors. It takes more time to load than the static web page. Dynamic web pages are used where the information is changed frequently, for example, stock prices, weather information, etc.

## Front End Development

Front End Development: The part of a website that the user interacts with directly is termed the front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application. It includes everything that users experience directly: text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, and navigation menu. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the languages used for Front End development. The structure, design, behavior, and content of everything seen on browser screens when websites, web applications, or mobile apps are opened up, is implemented by front End developers. Responsiveness and performance are two main objectives of the Front End. The developer must ensure that the site is responsive i.e. it appears correctly on devices of all sizes no part of the website should behave abnormally irrespective of the size of the screen.

### Front end Languages

The front end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed below:

- HTML: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to design the front-end portion of web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. The markup language is used to define the text documentation within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.

- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.

- JavaScript: JavaScript is a famous scripting language used to create magic on the sites to make the site interactive for the user. It is used to enhancing the functionality of a website to running cool games and web-based software.

## Backend Development

Backend is the server-side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client-side of the website works fine. It is the part of the website that you cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application. Activities, like writing APIs, creating libraries, and working with system components without user interfaces or even systems of scientific programming, are also included in the backend.

### Back end Languages

- PHP: PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. Since PHP code executed on the server-side, so it is called a server-side scripting language.

- C++: It is a general-purpose programming language and widely used nowadays for competitive programming. It is also used as a backend language.

- Java: Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms. It is highly scalable. Java components are easily available.

- Python: Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.

- JavaScript: JavaScript can be used as both (front end and back end) programming languages.

- Node.js: Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser. You need to remember that NodeJS is not a framework, and it’s not a programming language. Most people are confused and understand it’s a framework or a programming language. We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App. It’s used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Wallmart, and so on.
