# Section 2: Setting up Your Machine

In this section, I prepared the development environment on my computer

## 1- The first thing I did is installed [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Visual Studio Code is a free open source text editor by Microsoft. VS Code is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Although the editor is relatively lightweight, it includes some powerful features that have made VS Code one of the most popular development environment tools in recent times.

VS Code supports a wide array of programming languages from Javascript, Java, C++, and Python to CSS, Go, and Dockerfile. Moreover, VS Code allows you to add on and even creating new extensions including code linters, debuggers

- Some extensions were also installed to facilitate the writing of the code like
    - [Babel ES6/ES7](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dzannotti.vscode-babel-coloring)
    - [Sublime Text Keymap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings)


## 2- The second thing I did is installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser

Node js allows us to run JavaScript files on our machine.
